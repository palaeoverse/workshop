- [Best practices](https://keichenseer.github.io/Writing_functions_in_R/#/best-practices) (e.g. documentation with roxygen2)
- [Testing and debugging](https://keichenseer.github.io/Writing_functions_in_R/#/testing-and-debugging) (e.g. the testthat package)
- [Advanced tools](https://keichenseer.github.io/Writing_functions_in_R/#/advanced-tools) (e.g. profiling)
