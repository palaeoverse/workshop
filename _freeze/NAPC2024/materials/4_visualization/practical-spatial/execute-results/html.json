First, let's load some packages that we've learned about from the previous practicals:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(palaeoverse)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(deeptime)\n```\n:::\n\n\n# Plotting vector spatial data\n\nNow, for plotting vector (points, lines, polygons) spatial data, we'll need the `sf` package. We'll also use the `rnaturalearth` package to get a map of the world. We'll need something to visualize, so let's also grab the tetrapod occurrence data from the `palaeoverse` package.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(sf)\nlibrary(rnaturalearth)\n\n# Get a map of the world\nworld <- ne_countries()\n\n# Get tetrapod occurrence data from palaeoverse\ndata(tetrapods)\n# Roughly calculate medium ages\ntetrapods$mid_age <- (tetrapods$max_ma + tetrapods$min_ma)/2\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe need to convert our occurrences to an `sf` object, so we'll use the convenient `st_as_sf()` function. This can be used to convert any sort of coordinate data (points, lines, polygons) to `sf` objects. In other cases, like with the `rnaturalearth` package, the data may already be in the `sf` format. Once you have an `sf` object, it's fairly simple to plot it with `ggplot` using `geom_sf()`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Convert the occurrence coordinates to an \"sf\" object\ntetrapods_sf <- st_as_sf(tetrapods, coords = c(\"lng\", \"lat\"),\n                         crs = \"+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84 +no_defs\")\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_sf(data = world) +\n  geom_sf(data = tetrapods_sf, color = \"maroon\", shape = 3) +\n  theme_classic()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](practical-spatial_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe can color the occurrences based on the period they formed during. First we just add a new column to our existing `sf` object (which also doubles as a `data.frame` object). Then we use this column as an aesthetic in our `ggplot` call, just like we learned about in the previous practical.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntetrapods_sf$period <- cut(tetrapods_sf$mid_age,\n                           breaks = c(periods$max_age, 0),\n                           labels = periods$name)\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_sf(data = world) +\n  geom_sf(data = tetrapods_sf, aes(color = period), shape = 3) +\n  scale_color_geo(name = \"Period\", dat = \"periods\") +\n  theme_classic()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](practical-spatial_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nPretty cool! Now on to some more complex topics...\n\n## Projections\n\nWhen you plot latitude and longitude as y and x coordinates, respectively, this is called the geographical projection. However, this is a heavily distorted view of the Earth. Here, we'll learn how to plot our spatial graphs in with a more appropriate projection (or \"coordinate system\"). Documentation for many different projections is available on the [EPSG website](https://epsg.io/). In this example, we'll use the Robinson projection (i.e., \"ESRI:54030\"). Note that this projection still isn't perfect. For example, distortion close to the poles is severe. However, due to the curvature of the meridians, distortion declines to moderate levels moving away from the poles. In order to change the overall projection of your `ggplot` plot, you simply use the `coord_sf()` function. Since the plot is no longer a rectangle, we also make our own bounding box to place on top of the plot.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Set up a bounding box\nbbox <- st_graticule(crs = st_crs(\"ESRI:54030\"),\n                     lat = c(-89.9, 89.9), lon = c(-179.9, 179.9))\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_sf(data = world) +\n  geom_sf(data = tetrapods_sf, aes(color = period), shape = 3) +\n  geom_sf(data = bbox) +\n  coord_sf(crs = st_crs(\"ESRI:54030\")) +\n  scale_color_geo(name = \"Period\", dat = \"periods\") +\n  theme_classic()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](practical-spatial_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nBoth visually appealing and more geographically accurate, nice! Let's use this projection (and bounding box) for most of our future spatial plots.\n\n## Organismal silhouettes\n\nWe could also color the points based on taxonomy. For example, here they are colored by the Class of the fossil occurrence:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot() +\n  geom_sf(data = world) +\n  geom_sf(data = tetrapods_sf, aes(color = class)) +\n  geom_sf(data = bbox) +\n  coord_sf(crs = st_crs(\"ESRI:54030\")) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"black\", \"royalblue3\", \"seagreen1\"),\n                     name = \"Class\") +\n  theme_classic()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](practical-spatial_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThat looks nice! However, one concern might be that people don't know what those taxonomic names refer to. Instead (or in addition to the taxonomy), we could use organism silhouettes for the points using the `rphylopic` package. Note that this might take a while to render because of all of the individual silhouettes.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(rphylopic)\n\n# Remove duplicates\ntetrapods_unique <- unique(tetrapods[, c(\"class\", \"lat\", \"lng\")])\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_sf(data = world) +\n  geom_phylopic(data = tetrapods_unique,\n                aes(x = lng, y = lat, name = class, color = class),\n                size = 4E5, alpha = 0.75, show.legend = TRUE,\n                key_glyph = phylopic_key_glyph(name = c(\"Osteichthyes\",\n                                                        \"Reptilia\",\n                                                        \"Saurischia\"))) +\n  geom_sf(data = bbox) +\n  coord_sf(crs = st_crs(\"ESRI:54030\"), default_crs = st_crs(4326)) +\n  scale_color_manual(name = \"Class\",\n                     values = c(\"black\", \"royalblue3\", \"seagreen1\"),\n                     guide = guide_legend(override.aes = list(size = 1,\n                                                              alpha = 1))) +\n  theme_void()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](practical-spatial_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWell, in hindsight this might not be much better with all of the overlap...I'll leave it to you to decide how to best display this information.\n\n## Spatial summaries\n\nThere are also lots of functions available in the `sf` package to perform spatial summaries. Let's go ahead and calculate the number of fossil occurrences in this dataset that have been found within each country across the world. First we find the intersection of the two spatial objects (`st_intersection()`), which identifies which country each occurrence is in. Then we tabulate the number of occurrences per country (`table()`). Then we can go ahead and plot the results as a bar plot.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsf_use_s2(FALSE)\n# It takes a little of time\nfos_over_country <- st_intersection(x = world, y = tetrapods_sf)\nfos_per_country <- as.data.frame(sort(table(fos_over_country$sovereignt)))\nhead(fos_per_country)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n        Var1 Freq\n1      Chile    1\n2   Ethiopia    1\n3      Japan    1\n4 Mozambique    1\n5   Pakistan    1\n6    Somalia    1\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Plot with ggplot\nggplot(fos_per_country, aes(x = Freq, y = Var1)) +\n  geom_col() +\n  scale_x_continuous(name = \"# of Occurrences\") +\n  scale_y_discrete(name = NULL) +\n  theme_classic()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](practical-spatial_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe cool thing about spatial plots with `ggplot2` is that you can use other aesthetics like color, fill, etc. just like you would with other types of plots. Let's go ahead and combine our occurrence counts with our country spatial data, then plot the counts as the fill color of the countries.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Combine the fossil counts with the `world` spatial data\nworld$n_fossils <- fos_per_country$Freq[match(world$sovereignt, fos_per_country$Var1)]\n\n# Fill in the countries just like you would in any other plot\nggplot() +\n  geom_sf(data = world, aes(fill = n_fossils)) +\n  geom_sf(data = bbox) +\n  coord_sf(crs = st_crs(\"ESRI:54030\")) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_c(name = \"# of Fossil\\nOccurrences\") +\n  theme_classic()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](practical-spatial_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n# Plotting raster spatial data\n\nNow we'll learn how to handle and plot raster (pixel) spatial data. First we'll need to load the `terra` and `tidyterra` packages. These packages include lots of functions for handling and summarizing raster data (`terra`) and plotting it with `ggplot2` (`tidyterra`). We'll also load the `rpaleoclim` package which allows us to access paleo-environmental data from the paleoclim [website](http://www.paleoclim.org/).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(terra)\nlibrary(tidyterra)\nlibrary(rpaleoclim)\n```\n:::\n\n\nLet's use environmental data from the last glacial maximum (LGM, ~21,000 years ago). We'll first preview what the temperature and precipitation maps look like. We'll use the `autoplot()` function from `tidyterra` to plot these two environmental variables of interest.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Get climate variables for last glacial maximum\nPclim_lgm <- paleoclim(period = \"lgm\", resolution = \"10m\")\n# Plot temperature (the original values are ÂºC*10)\nautoplot(Pclim_lgm$bio_1/10)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](practical-spatial_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Plot precipitation in mm/year\nautoplot(Pclim_lgm$bio_12)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](practical-spatial_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-2.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe `autoplot()` function acts as a wrapper for `ggplot()` and `tidyterra::geom_spatraster()`. You can also use those functions individually and add additional `ggplot2` commands to make a customized figure:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot() +\n  geom_spatraster(data = Pclim_lgm$bio_1/10) +\n  geom_sf(data = tetrapods_sf) +\n  geom_sf(data = bbox) +\n  coord_sf(crs = st_crs(\"ESRI:54030\")) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_c(name = \"Temperature (ÂºC)\", na.value = \"white\") +\n  theme_classic()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](practical-spatial_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n# Combining plots\n\nLet's take this moment to learn how to combine different plots into a single figure. For this example we'll use the `ggarrange2()` function from `deeptime`; however, there are many other options, including the [`cowplot`](https://wilkelab.org/cowplot/index.html) and [`patchwork`](https://patchwork.data-imaginist.com/) packages.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Convert temperature data to sf\ngg1 <- ggplot() +\n  geom_spatraster(data = Pclim_lgm$bio_1/10) +\n  geom_sf(data = tetrapods_sf, aes(color = as.factor(class))) +\n  geom_sf(data = bbox) +\n  coord_sf(crs = st_crs(\"ESRI:54030\")) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_c(name = \"Temperature (ÂºC)\", option = \"magma\",\n                       na.value = \"white\") +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"black\", \"royalblue3\", \"seagreen1\"),\n                     name = \"Class\") +\n  theme_classic() +\n  theme(legend.box = \"horizontal\")\ngg2 <- ggplot() +\n  geom_spatraster(data = Pclim_lgm$bio_12) +\n  geom_sf(data = tetrapods_sf, aes(color = as.factor(diet))) +\n  geom_sf(data = bbox) +\n  coord_sf(crs = st_crs(\"ESRI:54030\")) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_c(name = \"Precipitation (mm/yr)\",\n                       na.value = \"white\") +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"slateblue1\", \"red4\",\"maroon2\",\"yellow2\"),\n                     name = \"Diet\") +\n  theme_classic() +\n  theme(legend.box = \"horizontal\")\n\nggarrange2(gg1, gg2, ncol = 1)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](practical-spatial_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNote that these functions for combining plots work for any kinds of `ggplot2` plots, not just spatial ones.\n\n# Paleomaps\n\nFinally, as paleontologists, we are often interested in the paleocoordinates of fossils. In order to visualize these, we'll first need to estimate the paleocoordinates of our fossils. As you've already learned, we can use the `palaeorotate()` function to achieve this. For time's sake, we'll only look at Early Permian occurrences.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntetrapods_subset <- tetrapods[tetrapods$mid_age == 285.7, ]\ntetrapods_GOLONKA <- palaeorotate(tetrapods_subset, age = \"mid_age\", \n                                   method = \"point\", model = \"GOLONKA\")\n\ntetrapods_GOLONKA_sf <- st_as_sf(tetrapods_GOLONKA,\n                                 coords = c(\"p_lng\", \"p_lat\"),\n                                 crs = \"+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84 +no_defs\")\nnrow(tetrapods_GOLONKA_sf)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 15\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nLooks like we only have 15 occurrences from this interval. Next, we can use the `reconstruct()` function from the `rgplates` package to retrieve a paleomap of the continents during the Early Permian. We can combine these two sets of data to generate a beautiful map:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(rgplates)\nplates <- reconstruct(\"coastlines\", age = 285.7, model = \"GOLONKA\")\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_sf(data = plates, fill = \"azure4\", color = NA) +\n  geom_sf(data = tetrapods_GOLONKA_sf, color = \"red\") +\n  geom_sf(data = bbox) +\n  coord_sf(crs = st_crs(\"ESRI:54030\")) +\n  theme_classic()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](practical-spatial_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-15-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAs you can see, our 15 Early Permian occurrences are from only two sites, both fairly close to each other. Regardless, that's a pretty nice plot! We'll leave it to you to make plots for other time intervals!\n",
