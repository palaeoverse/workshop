General familiarity with R allows users to automate routine tasks, create reproducible analytical workflows, and expand the potential of their research. This workshop aims to introduce participants to the versatility of R for cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing paleobiological and ecological data. It will cover topics including: data acquisition from biodiversity databases such the Paleobiology Database, Neotoma Paleoecology Database, and Global Biodiversity Information Facility; building workflows in R to clean and analyze data; data visualization and synthesis; and guidelines (e.g., FAIR and CARE principles) and tools (e.g., GitHub) for creating more reproducible code and accessible documentation. In doing so, this workshop will introduce attendees to palaeoverse, an R package that supports data preparation and exploration for paleobiological analysis. Participants will also become familiar with additional packages developed by Palaeoverse [www.palaeoverse.org](www.palaeoverse.org), such as rphylopic. More broadly, this event aims to connect participants working in different fields who share a common interest in data science and provide a platform for participants to gain experience working collaboratively in R to generate reproducible interdisciplinary research.\n\n## Arrival\n\nThe event starts at XXX on the XXX and will take place at XXX.\n\nThe full schedule for the workshop is available [here](#schedule).\n\n## Schedule\n\n| Time            | Event                       |\n|-----------------|-----------------------------|\n| **PLACEHOLDER** | **PLACEHOLDER**             |\n| **PLACEHOLDER** | **PLACEHOLDER**             |\n| **PLACEHOLDER** | **PLACEHOLDER**             |\n| **PLACEHOLDER** | **PLACEHOLDER**             |\n| **PLACEHOLDER** | **PLACEHOLDER**             |\n| **PLACEHOLDER** | **PLACEHOLDER**             |\n\n## Instructors\n\nThis edition of the Workshop event is organised and led by the following members of the Palaeoverse team.\n\n::: {.grid}\n\n::: {.g-col-4}\n\n![INSTRUCTOR 1](https://palaeoverse.org/images/logo.png)\n\n:::\n\n::: {.g-col-4}\n\n![INSTRUCTOR 2](https://palaeoverse.org/images/logo.png)\n\n:::\n\n::: {.g-col-4}\n\n![INSTRUCTOR 3](https://palaeoverse.org/images/logo.png)\n\n:::\n\n:::\n\n## Installation\n\nPlease ensure that you have the latest version of R for the workshop, which can be downloaded [here](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/).
