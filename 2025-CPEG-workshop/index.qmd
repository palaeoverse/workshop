University of Zürich (Zürich, Switzerland)

# Welcome

R is one of the most popular languages in the world of data science and has been widely adopted by the paleobiological and ecological communities for data analysis. General familiarity with R allows users to automate routine tasks, create reproducible analytical workflows, and expand the potential of their research. This workshop aims to introduce participants to the versatility of R for cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing paleobiological and ecological data. It will cover topics including: data acquisition from biodiversity databases such the Paleobiology Database, Neotoma Paleoecology Database, and Global Biodiversity Information Facility; building workflows in R to clean and analyze data; data visualization and synthesis; and guidelines (e.g., FAIR and CARE principles) and tools (e.g., GitHub) for creating more reproducible code and accessible documentation. In doing so, this workshop will introduce attendees to palaeoverse, an R package that supports data preparation and exploration for paleobiological analysis. Participants will also become familiar with additional packages developed by Palaeoverse [www.palaeoverse.org](www.palaeoverse.org), such as rphylopic. More broadly, this event aims to connect participants working in different fields who share a common interest in data science and provide a platform for participants to gain experience working collaboratively in R to generate reproducible interdisciplinary research.
