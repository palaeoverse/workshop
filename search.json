Highlights include the Micrarium and the (in)famous Jar of Moles.\nGreen Spaces – Head just a few minutes away from Euston Road and you’ll find a variety of green spaces perfect for a short stroll, reading a book, or a picnic. Close to UCL you can find Gordon Square, Tavistock Square Gardens, and Russell Square. For a larger space, we’d recommend the trip to Regent’s Park, home to London Zoo.\nWellcome Collection (10am–6pm) – Located opposite the Kathleen Lonsdale Building, the Wellcome Collection hosts a series of rotating exhibitions focused on science, medicine, life, and art.

You can pre-order and collect, or they will also deliver to UCL. Prices for main dishes range from £5–10.\nNoodle & Snack 面道坊 - amazing handmade noodles and broths! The restaurant is small, and it can get very busy around lunch and dinner if you’re hoping to sit in, but they also do takeaway. A main and a side should cost £10–20.\nFranco Manca – Good quality sourdough pizzas for &lt;£10. Both eat in and takeaway options are available.\nRosa’s Thai – A large selection of tasty Thai dishes with a sizeable number of vegetarian and vegan options. Lunch will likely cost £10–20 per person.

Well, the Palaeoverse project aims to bring the palaeobiology community together through various means.

In palaeobiology, these tools are frequently borrowed or repurposed from ecology (e.g. vegan and iNEXT). While packages exist to support fossil data analyses (e.g. claddis and divDyn), there is a lack of packages to support fossil data preparation or exploration. This results in the community often producing their own custom scripts.\nThe palaeoverse package provides auxiliary functions to support data preparation and exploration, with the intention of improving code readability, reusability, and reproducibility.",

The palaeorotate function provides two methods to reconstruct palaeocoordinates for fossil occurrences. The first method, “point”, uses the GPlates Web Service, which estimates palaeocoordinates for point data, with eight different models available. The second method, “grid”, uses pre-generated reconstruction files to estimate palaeocoordinates. This approach is much faster than the point method for large datasets, and also allows easy exploration. Additional functionality for the second method allows the user to calculate the palaeogeographic uncertainty in reconstructions from across the eight available models with the palaeolatitudinal range and maximum circle distance between points calculated.",

One frequently encountered issue is spelling variations of the same taxon name. This can have undesirable consequences when calculating metrics such as taxonomic richness. The tax check function computes character string distances between taxonomic names and returns those under a user-defined dissimilarity threshold. The function can also be used within groups such as here with family. As you can see this might be appropriate in some instances. While flagged taxonomic names can be similar in spelling, taxa can belong to different families.",

Temporal data might be provided as either character-based interval names or numeric ages, and might conform to different timescales. The look_up function is provided to help assign a common timescale. The function can be used to generate numeric ages from GTS interval names or an interval key can be provided by the user to link interval names to the Geological Time Scale. This interval key consist of three columns with the first containing the interval name followed by the early and late international stage the interval name correlates with. Interval key is provided an example dataset in palaeoverse.",

For example, if we want to calculate the number of occurrences per country in this example, or use the function tax unique per collection in this example. The group apply function also allows the user to run function over multiple grouping variables, for example in the third example we calculate the number of occurrences per unique collection and geological formation combination.",

    "text": "ggplot2 is designed around the “grammar of graphics”. In most cases you start with ggplot() and then supply a dataset and “aesthetic” mappings (with aes()). You then add on individual layers (like geom_point() or geom_histogram()) to add the visualization(s) that you want. Let’s first try making a scatterplot using some built-in data about car mileage (mpg). In this case, we’ll plot the highway mileage with respect to the engine size (displacement). Note that in this case, instead of calling functions separately, we chain them together with the + operator.\n\n# load the ggplot2 package\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n\n# check out the mileage data\nhead(mpg)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 11\n  manufacturer model displ  year   cyl trans      drv     cty   hwy fl    class \n  &lt;chr&gt;        &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; \n1 audi         a4      1.8  1999     4 auto(l5)   f        18    29 p     compa…\n2 audi         a4      1.8  1999     4 manual(m5) f        21    29 p     compa…\n3 audi         a4      2    2008     4 manual(m6) f        20    31 p     compa…\n4 audi         a4      2    2008     4 auto(av)   f        21    30 p     compa…\n5 audi         a4      2.8  1999     6 auto(l5)   f        16    26 p     compa…\n6 audi         a4      2.8  1999     6 manual(m5) f        18    26 p     compa…\n\n\n\nggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + \n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou’ll notice that with just a couple of lines, we’ve already made a pretty nice visualization. ggplot2 does most of the work for us once we specify our x and y variables. Let’s go a step further and color the points by another variable (e.g., the class of the car). With ggplot2, all that requires is specifying another aesthetic:\n\nggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class)) + \n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that ggplot2 comes with its own default color scheme. I would strongly discourage you from using the default colors. Instead, we’ll try out some of the accessible color palettes we talked about earlier. First, let’s try one of the viridis color palettes. Since this palette is included in ggplot2, all we need to do is add the proper “scale” to our ggplot() call.\n\nggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class)) + \n  geom_point() +\n  scale_color_viridis_d()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHmm…with this many colors, it becomes a little hard to distinguish between the colors with this color palette. Let’s try one of the brewer color palettes.\n\nggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class)) + \n  geom_point() +\n  scale_color_brewer(palette = \"Set1\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOutside of color, there are many other aspects of the graph that we can modify using “scale”s. For example, we can modify the x and y axes:\n\nggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class)) + \n  geom_point() +\n  scale_color_brewer(name = \"Vehicle Class\", palette = \"Set1\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(name = \"Engine Displacement (l)\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(name = \"Highway Mileage (mpg)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe last basic thing you might want to do with ggplot2 is modify the style of the visualization. This is extremely customizable, but the first place to start is with a built-in theme. I personally prefer the classic theme:\n\nggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class)) + \n  geom_point() +\n  scale_color_brewer(name = \"Vehicle Class\", palette = \"Set1\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(name = \"Engine Displacement (l)\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(name = \"Highway Mileage (mpg)\") +\n  theme_classic()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing this built-in theme has changed many visual aspects of the graph, including changing the plot background color, adding axis lines, and removing the internal grid lines. If you look very closely, however, the axis tick labels are still a slight grey. We can use the theme() function to further customize the appearance and change this. In this case, we’ll make the axis text elements have a black color.\n\nggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class)) + \n  geom_point() +\n  scale_color_brewer(name = \"Vehicle Class\", palette = \"Set1\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(name = \"Engine Displacement (l)\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(name = \"Highway Mileage (mpg)\") +\n  theme_classic() +\n  theme(axis.text = element_text(color = \"black\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd there we have it! With just 7 lines we’ve created what I would say is a publication quality graph! ggplot does a lot of the tedious work for you, giving you time to focus on the more important aspects, such as labeling and color. Admittedly, I’ve spent a LOT of time on these aspects in the past…\nMore information about all of the hierarchical theme components that you can customize is available here. In order to change many of these components, you need to use theme elements like we did above with element_text(). That and other theme elements are documented here.",

The counts are tabulated for you.\n\n\nBoxplots and Violin Plotss\nWe can visualize the density of values for a single variable across a discrete variable with boxplots or violin plots:\n\nggplot(mpg, aes(x = as.factor(cyl), y = hwy)) + \n  geom_boxplot() +\n  scale_x_discrete(name = \"# Cylinders\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(name = \"Highway Mileage (mpg)\") +\n  theme_classic() +\n  theme(axis.text = element_text(color = \"black\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(mpg, aes(x = as.factor(cyl), y = hwy)) + \n  geom_violin(scale = \"width\", draw_quantiles = c(0.25, 0.5, 0.75)) +\n  scale_x_discrete(name = \"# Cylinders\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(name = \"Highway Mileage (mpg)\") +\n  theme_classic() +\n  theme(axis.text = element_text(color = \"black\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that many of these “geom”s have lots of options. For example, we’ve decided to scale all of the violin plots to the same width and to draw the quartiles on them (mimicking the boxplots above).\n\n\n2D Contours\nWe can also visualize the density of values across two continuos variables using a 2D contour. Here we’ll use the built-in Old Faithful waiting time/eruption duration data (faithful). We’ll expand the axes a little bit to better show the contours:\n\nggplot(faithful, aes(x = eruptions, y = waiting)) +\n  geom_density_2d(linewidth = 0.25, colour = \"black\") +\n  xlim(0.5, 6) +\n  ylim(35, 110) +\n  theme_classic() +\n  theme(axis.text = element_text(color = \"black\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTime Series\nWe’ll use the built-in economics dataset to explore visualizing a time series. In this case, we are looking at unemployment over time:\n\nggplot(economics, aes(x = date, y = unemploy)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  theme_classic() +\n  theme(axis.text = element_text(color = \"black\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngeom_path() lets you explore how two variables are related over time. For example, unemployment and personal savings rate:\n\nggplot(economics, aes(x = unemploy/pop, y = psavert)) +\n  geom_path(aes(colour = as.numeric(date))) +\n  theme_classic() +\n  theme(axis.text = element_text(color = \"black\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote how we’ve used multiple columns of the data to define the x-axis here.",

However, this is a heavily distorted view of the Earth. Here, we’ll learn how to plot our spatial graphs in with a more appropriate projection (or “coordinate system”). Documentation for many different projections is available on the EPSG website. In this example, we’ll use the Robinson projection (i.e., “ESRI:54030”). Note that this projection still isn’t perfect. For example, distortion close to the poles is severe. However, due to the curvature of the meridians, distortion declines to moderate levels moving away from the poles. In order to change the overall projection of your ggplot plot, you simply use the coord_sf() function. Since the plot is no longer a rectangle, we also make our own bounding box to place on top of the plot.\n\n# Set up a bounding box\nbbox &lt;- st_graticule(crs = st_crs(\"ESRI:54030\"),\n                     lat = c(-89.9, 89.9), lon = c(-179.9, 179.9))\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_sf(data = world) +\n  geom_sf(data = tetrapods_sf, aes(color = period), shape = 3) +\n  geom_sf(data = bbox) +\n  coord_sf(crs = st_crs(\"ESRI:54030\")) +\n  scale_color_geo(name = \"Period\", dat = \"periods\") +\n  theme_classic()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth visually appealing and more geographically accurate, nice! Let’s use this projection (and bounding box) for most of our future spatial plots.",

If you are getting to the point where you find it hard to distinguish between two symbols or colors, you probably have too many.\nIn the article this was included in, they only discussed Germany, Greece, Netherlands, and Spain. Therefore, including the other countries as separate colors overcomplicated the figure and made the main point harder to discern. Condensing them to a single “Others” category makes the plot easier to digest and makes the point clearer.",

Although this saves valuable space on the page, it has consequences — as shown in this chart, from March 2017. The story is about how scientific publishing is dominated by men. All data points are equally interesting and relevant to the story. But by presenting such a lot of data — four research-field categories as well as the share of inventors — the information is hard to take in.",
